For now, the figure will show that for the same firing frequency, the mean of Na and KDR Gbar is different.
And, if you incorporate Na_P, we get firing bistatbility in models with high DBL but not in models with no DBL

activemodels_1compt_old.json
activemodels_imp.json

activemodels_pas.json
activemodels_pas_old.json
These are models made for comparing Gbars among the three model types. filteractivemodel.py is used for filtering out invalid models. All the models are in _old files and after filtering, the _old suffix is removed.

activemodels.json
activemodels_bis.json
These are models made for the Bistability hypothesis
