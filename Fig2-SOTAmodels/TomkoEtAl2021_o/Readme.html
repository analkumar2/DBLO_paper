Matus Tomko, Lubica Benuskova, Peter Jedlicka (2021)
A new reduced-morphology model for CA1 pyramidal cells 
and its validation and comparison with other models using HippoUnit

<p>
The code for CA1 pyramidal cell morphology was adapted (by adding oblique branches) based on Cutsuridis et al:

</p>
<p>
Active and passive mechanisms were adapted based on Migliore et al: <a href="https://modeldb.yale.edu/244688">https://modeldb.yale.edu/244688</a>
</p>
<p>
The model was optimized and tested using HippoUnit (Saray et al., 2020):

</p>
<p>There are two files of the model. "Original" is the original model used in the paper.
In the "original" model, side branches are connected to the middle of sections forming the apical trunk.
Therefore it is important to keep the odd number of sections segments, because should we want to change
the number of segments, if the previous and new nseg values are both odd, the node at 0.5 will persist. 
In the "updated" model, each apical trunk section is divided into two sections of equal lenghts and 
side braches are connected to the ends of sections. The number and position of the side branches are preserved.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Install NEURON with Python support (this is enabled in all NEURON installers):
        <a href="https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download">neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Compile the mod files using "nrnivmodl Mods" (works on all platforms; other options are also available on other platforms)
    </li>
    <li>
        Run the python script for the Figure to be reproduced (see the
following) in the same directory.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The script <code>bAP.py</code> produces a simulation of the backpropagation of 
the action potential into the apical trunk.</p>

Note an increase in bAP attenuation with increasing distance from soma. 
</p>
<p>
The script <code>oblique_integration.py</code> produces a simulation of 
the synaptic integration of 5 synchronous synapses
in the proximal and distal location of the oblique dendrite.

Note dendritic spikes (orange trace) triggered by synaptic activation.</p>
